Jacob and Katie are getting married!

Join us in lovely Seattle to tie the knot and raise a glass in September of 2015.

The ceremony will be on Saturday, September 5th during the afternoon on the MV Skansonia, 
a retired ferry on Lake Union in Seattle.  The evening after the ceremony, we will host 
a great big house party at the Purple, our home in Ballard.  It is the purple one with 
the chickens.

For our east cost friends and family, please join us for a reception in Bruce and Barbara 
Davis' backyard on Saturday, September 12th for music and wild, wonderful West Virginia 
festivities.

While we know the country is big, we encourage all of our friends and family to join us 
at any or all of the celebrations.  We'd love to see the Charlestonians basking in Seattle
sun and the Kelso folks eating barbecue in Scott Depot.

<h3 style="text-align:left;">Jacob and Katie are getting married!</h3>

<div style="text-align:left;">
	<p>
		Join us in lovely Seattle to tie the knot and raise a glass this Labor Day Weekend, 2015.
	</p>
	<p>
		Our wedding ceremony will be on the afternoon of Saturday, September 5th 
		aboard a retired ferry boat on Lake Union named <a href="http://www.skansonia.com/">The MV Skansonia</a>.
		Saturday evening we will host a great big house party at The Purple, our home in Ballard.  It is the purple one with 
		the chickens.
	</p>
	<p>
		For our east coast friends and family, please join us for a reception in Bruce and Barbara 
		Davis' backyard. On Saturday, September 12th we'll have music and wild, wonderful West Virginia 
		festivities.
	</p>
	<p>
		While we know the country is big, we encourage all of our friends and family to join us 
		at any or all of the celebrations.  We'd love to see the Charlestonians basking in the Seattle
		sun and the Kelso folks eating barbecue in Scott Depot.

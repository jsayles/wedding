Jacob and Katie are getting married!

Join us in lovely Seattle to tie the knot and raise a glass this Labor Day Weekend, 2015.

Our wedding ceremony will be on the afternoon of Saturday, September 5th aboard a retired 
ferry boat on Lake Union named The MV Skansonia.  Saturday evening we will host a great big 
house party at The Purple, our home in Ballard.  It is the purple one with the chickens.

For our East Coast friends and family, please join us for a reception in Bruce and Barbara 
Davis' backyard. On Saturday, September 12th we'll have music and wild, wonderful West Virginia 
festivities.

While we know the country is big, we encourage all of our friends and family to join us 
at any or all of the celebrations.  We'd love to see the Charlestonians basking in the 
Seattle sun and the Kelso folks eating barbecue in Scott Depot.
